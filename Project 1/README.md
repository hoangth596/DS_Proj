    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Sklearn
    - Tensorflow

No addition installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation

For this project I was interested in supervising exploratory data analysis using an Employee Satisfaction dataset found on Kaggle containing 15,000 employee information from a company to predict:

    - The potential of an employee to leave the company?

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed.

## File Descriptions

There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post

The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available here:
